# SettingUpLinuxInitialConfig
This is what I usually do when I create a Linux virtual machine or server. This repo is to remind me of my steps, speed up my process, and to keep track of any other updates I like to do.

* Might have to make the scripts executable if they cannot be ran right away after cloning repo.
``` sudo chmod 700 ```
